Overview
What Is AJAX? It stands for “Asynchronous JavaScript and XML“.

I’ll try to explain it in the simplest way: Using AJAX will prevent re-loading the whole page for every button click you make. As a result, it makes the user experience better. Your web app will be faster.

Ajax is not a technology, but a group of technologies. This can include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side scripting like PHP.

I highly recommend studying the previous tutorials first before proceeding here. But if you think you can take this one, then go on.

This tutorial will focus on creating, reading, updating, and deleting database records. We will do it using JavaScript, JSON, and PHP.

jQuery will help us with the AJAX part. JSON data will be handled by the REST API built using PHP.

Let’s proceed to the step-by-step tutorial of our LEVEL 1 source code. Enjoy!

Set Up The REST API
In this tutorial, we are going to use a REST API built with PHP.

We did not include REST API source code because we want you to focus on learning how to code with AJAX, not PHP.

But the good news is, we made a separate tutorial about how to build a simple REST API with PHP. Click here to learn the step-by-step PHP REST API tutorial.

I highly recommend learning our REST API tutorial first. This is because we are going to use that API for the rest of this tutorial.

But if you already have your own REST API that will work with this tutorial, that’s okay as well.

In my case, one example where I can access the REST API is: http://localhost/api/product/read.php

That link will show me the list of products from the database, in JSON format. It looks like the following screenshot.


The data above will be consumed by our AJAX app. The list of products will be displayed in the Bootstrap table with buttons like “Read One”, “Update” and “Delete”. You will see it in the “How To Read JSON Data Using jQuery AJAX?” section of this tutorial.

By the way, I’m using a Chrome extension called JSONView to make the JSON data readable in the browser.

Basic Files & Folders
File Structure
We will have the following files and folders at the end of this LEVEL 1 source code tutorial.

├─ app/
├─── assets/
├────── css/
├───────── style.css
├────── js/
├───────── bootbox.min.js
├───────── jquery.js
├─── products/
├────── create-product.js
├────── delete-product.js
├────── read-one-product.js
├────── read-products.js
├────── update-product.js
├─── app.js
├─ index.html

On the next sections, we will start creating the files and folders to achieve the one above.

Create index.html file
Create index.html file on your project’s main folder. Open that file and put the following code.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
 
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
 
    <title>Read Products</title>

    <!-- custom CSS -->
    <link href="app/assets/css/style.css" rel="stylesheet" />
 
</head>
<body>
 
<!-- our app will be injected here -->
<div id="app"></div>
 
<!-- jQuery library -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"

        integrity="sha384-Tc5IQib027qvyjSMfHjOMaLkfuWVxZxUPnCJA7l2mCWNIpG9mGCD8wGNIcPD7Txa" crossorigin="anonymous">
    </script>
 
<!-- bootbox for confirm pop up -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootbox.js/4.4.0/bootbox.min.js"></script>
 
<!-- app js script -->
<script src="app/app.js"></script>
 
<!-- products scripts -->
<script src="app/products/read-products.js"></script>
<script src="app/products/create-product.js"></script>
<script src="app/products/read-one-product.js"></script>
<script src="app/products/update-product.js"></script>
<script src="app/products/delete-product.js"></script>
 
</body>
</html>
Create custom CSS file
Create “app” folder.
Open the “app” folder and create the “assets” folder.
Open the “assets” folder and create the “css” folder.
Open the “css” folder and create “style.css” file.
The “style.css" file is our custom CSS file. You can put any CSS in this file for additional web page styling. In our case, we have the following CSS code inside the “style.css” file.

.m-r-10px{ margin-right:10px; }
.m-b-10px{ margin-bottom:10px; }
.m-b-15px{ margin-bottom:15px; }
.m-b-20px{ margin-bottom:20px; }
.w-5-pct{ width:5%; }
.w-10-pct{ width:10%; }
.w-15-pct{ width:15%; }
.w-20-pct{ width:20%; }
.w-25-pct{ width:25%; }
.w-30-pct{ width:30%; }
.w-35-pct{ width:35%; }
.w-40-pct{ width:40%; }
.w-45-pct{ width:45%; }
.w-50-pct{ width:50%; }
.w-55-pct{ width:55%; }
.w-60-pct{ width:60%; }
.w-65-pct{ width:65%; }
.w-70-pct{ width:70%; }
.w-75-pct{ width:75%; }
.w-80-pct{ width:80%; }
.w-85-pct{ width:85%; }
.w-90-pct{ width:90%; }
.w-95-pct{ width:95%; }
.w-100-pct{ width:100%; }
.display-none{ display:none; }
.padding-bottom-2em{ padding-bottom:2em; }
.width-30-pct{ width:30%; }
.width-40-pct{ width:40%; }
.overflow-hidden{ overflow:hidden; }
.margin-right-1em{ margin-right:1em; }
.right-margin{ margin:0 .5em 0 0; }
.margin-bottom-1em { margin-bottom:1em; }
.margin-zero{ margin:0; }
.text-align-center{ text-align:center; }
Use jQuery, Bootstrap, and Bootbox.js libraries
As you can see in the index.html file, we are using jQuery and Bootbox.js libraries.

jQuery JavaScript library is needed to make it easy for us to control interactions like button click and form submission. In this tutorial, we are using jQuery version 3.6.0. jQuery CDN is here.

Bootstrap makes it easy for us to have a good-looking user interface. We are using Bootstrap version 3.3.7 in this tutorial. Bootstrap CDN is here.

Bootbox.js library is needed to make the “delete” confirmation dialog box look better. We are using Bootbox.js version 4.4.0 in this tutorial. Bootbox.js CDN is here.

Create app.js file
The “app.js” file contains some basic HTML and JavaScript functions that can be used by other JS files in our app.

Open “app” folder.
Inside that “app” folder, create “app.js” file.
Open “app.js” file and put the following code.
$(document).ready(function(){
 
    // app html
    var app_html=`
        <div class='container'>
 
            <div class='page-header'>
                <h1 id='page-title'>Read Products</h1>
            </div>
 
            <!-- this is where the contents will be shown. -->
            <div id='page-content'></div>
 
        </div>`;
 
    // inject to 'app' in index.html
    $("#app").html(app_html);
 
});
 
// change page title
function changePageTitle(page_title){
 
    // change page title
    $('#page-title').text(page_title);
 
    // change title tag
    document.title=page_title;
}
 
// function to make form values to json format
$.fn.serializeObject = function()
{
    var o = {};
    var a = this.serializeArray();
    $.each(a, function() {
        if (o[this.name] !== undefined) {
            if (!o[this.name].push) {
                o[this.name] = [o[this.name]];
            }
            o[this.name].push(this.value || '');
        } else {
            o[this.name] = this.value || '';
        }
    });
    return o;
};
Create “products” scripts
Now, we will create several JavaScript files.

Open “app” folder.
Create “products” folder inside “app” folder.
Create the following files inside “products” folder:
read-products.js
create-product.js
read-one-product.js
update-product.js
delete-product.js
What’s the code inside the JavaScript files above? For now, we will leave them empty. But we will fill them out in the next several sections of this tutorial.

Output
Our code so far will have almost empty output. It should look like the following.


How To Read JSON Data Using jQuery AJAX?
Show products on first page load
Open “app” folder.
Open “products” folder inside the “app” folder.
Open read-products.js file inside the “products” folder.
The following code will call the showProducts() method on first load of the web page.

The showProducts() will show the list of products in an HTML table. Put the following code inside read-products.js file.

$(document).ready(function(){
 
    // show list of product on first load
    showProducts();
 
});
 
// showProducts() method will be here
Show products on click of a button
The following code will call showProducts() method in a click of a button with read-products-button class.

The button can be found in the “create product” and “update product” HTML template. We will see it in the next sections.

Put the following code under the showProducts(); of the previous section.

// when a 'read products' button was clicked
$(document).on('click', '.read-products-button', function(){
    showProducts();
});
Create showProducts() function
Now we will create the showProducts() method. Replace // showProducts() method will be here comment in read-products.js file with the following code.

// function to show list of products
function showProducts(){
 
}
Get list of products
The following code will contact our API to get the list of products in JSON format. Put the following code after the opening curly brace of the previous section.

// get list of products from the API
$.getJSON("http://localhost/api/product/read.php", function(data){
 
});
Add “Create Product” button
We have to add a “Create Product” button in the “products list” view. We will make this button work later in this tutorial.

Place the following code after the opening curly brace of the previous section.

// html for listing products
var read_products_html=`
    <!-- when clicked, it will load the create product form -->
    <div id='create-product' class='btn btn-primary pull-right m-b-15px create-product-button'>
        <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-plus'></span> Create Product
    </div>
Build HTML table
We have to start building the HTML table where the list of products will appear.

The following code will build an HTML table with its heading. Place it after the previous section’s code.

<!-- start table -->
<table class='table table-bordered table-hover'>
 
    <!-- creating our table heading -->
    <tr>
        <th class='w-25-pct'>Name</th>
        <th class='w-10-pct'>Price</th>
        <th class='w-15-pct'>Category</th>
        <th class='w-25-pct text-align-center'>Action</th>
    </tr>`;
 
    // rows will be here
 
// end table
read_products_html+=`</table>`;
Build table row per record
We will loop through each record returned by the API. In each record, we will create a table row.

Aside from product data, the table row will have the “action” buttons as well. These include the “Read One”, “Edit” and “Delete” buttons.

Replace “// rows will be here” comment of the previous section with the following code.

// loop through returned list of data
$.each(data.records, function(key, val) {
 
    // creating new table row per record
    read_products_html+=`
        <tr>
 
            <td>` + val.name + `</td>
            <td>$` + val.price + `</td>
            <td>` + val.category_name + `</td>
 
            <!-- 'action' buttons -->
            <td>
                <!-- read product button -->
                <button class='btn btn-primary m-r-10px read-one-product-button' data-id='` + val.id + `'>
                    <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-eye-open'></span> Read
                </button>
 
                <!-- edit button -->
                <button class='btn btn-info m-r-10px update-product-button' data-id='` + val.id + `'>
                    <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-edit'></span> Edit
                </button>
 
                <!-- delete button -->
                <button class='btn btn-danger delete-product-button' data-id='` + val.id + `'>
                    <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-remove'></span> Delete
                </button>
            </td>
 
        </tr>`;
});
Inject to page content
We have to make the HTML table appear on our webpage. We will do this by injecting the table into the “page-content” div.

Place the following code after the closing “table” tag

// inject to 'page-content' of our app
$("#page-content").html(read_products_html);
5.9 Change page title
The following code will change the “title” seen on the web page and the “title” seen on the browser tab.

Place the following code after the previous section’s code.

// chage page title
changePageTitle("Read Products");
Output
After doing all the steps above, the output should look like the following.


How To Create or Insert Data Using jQuery AJAX?
Handle “Create Product” Button Click
Open “app” folder.
Open “products” folder inside the “app” folder.
Open create-product.js file inside the “products” folder.
The following code will handle a click of a button. This button should have “create-product-button” class.

Place the following code inside create-product.js file.

$(document).ready(function(){
 
    // show html form when 'create product' button was clicked
    $(document).on('click', '.create-product-button', function(){
        // categories api call will be here
    });
 
    // 'create product form' handle will be here
});
Get list of categories from API
We need to get list of categories from the API because we will build the “categories” select field. This is where the user can select the category of the product.

Replace “// categories api call will be here” of the previous section with the following code.

// load list of categories
$.getJSON("http://localhost/api/category/read.php", function(data){
 
});
Build “categories option” select field
This is where we build the HTML “select” field with the “categories” option.

Place the following code after the opening curly brace of the previous section.

// build categories option html
// loop through returned list of data
var categories_options_html=`<select name='category_id' class='form-control'>`;
$.each(data.records, function(key, val){
    categories_options_html+=`<option value='` + val.id + `'>` + val.name + `</option>`;
});
categories_options_html+=`</select>`;
Add “Read Products” button
The “read products” button is needed so that we can go back to the products list.

Place the following code after the previous section’s code.

// we have our html form here where product information will be entered
// we used the 'required' html5 property to prevent empty fields
var create_product_html=`
 
    <!-- 'read products' button to show list of products -->
    <div id='read-products' class='btn btn-primary pull-right m-b-15px read-products-button'>
        <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-list'></span> Read Products
    </div>
Build “Create Product” HTML Form
Now we will build the actual “creat product” HTML form. This is where the user can enter the new product information that will be sent to the server.

Place the following code after the previous section’s code.

<!-- 'create product' html form -->
<form id='create-product-form' action='#' method='post' border='0'>
    <table class='table table-hover table-responsive table-bordered'>
 
        <!-- name field -->
        <tr>
            <td>Name</td>
            <td><input type='text' name='name' class='form-control' required /></td>
        </tr>
 
        <!-- price field -->
        <tr>
            <td>Price</td>
            <td><input type='number' min='1' name='price' class='form-control' required /></td>
        </tr>
 
        <!-- description field -->
        <tr>
            <td>Description</td>
            <td><textarea name='description' class='form-control' required></textarea></td>
        </tr>
 
        <!-- categories 'select' field -->
        <tr>
            <td>Category</td>
            <td>` + categories_options_html + `</td>
        </tr>
 
        <!-- button to submit form -->
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td>
                <button type='submit' class='btn btn-primary'>
                    <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-plus'></span> Create Product
                </button>
            </td>
        </tr>
 
    </table>
</form>`;
Show “Create Product” form and change page title
We have to make the HTML button and form appear on our web page. We will change the page title as well.

Place the following code after the previous section’s code.

// inject html to 'page-content' of our app
$("#page-content").html(create_product_html);
 
// chage page title
changePageTitle("Create Product");
Handle “create product” form submit
If the “create product” form is submitted, we need a script to handle it.

Find “// 'create product form' handle will be here” and replace it with the following code.

// will run if create product form was submitted
$(document).on('submit', '#create-product-form', function(){
    // form data will be here
});
Get form data
This is how we get data entered in our “create product” HTML form.

Replace “// form data will be here” of the previous section with the following code.

// get form data
var form_data=JSON.stringify($(this).serializeObject());
Now we will send the data to the server.

Place the following code after the previous section’s code.

// submit form data to api
$.ajax({
    url: "http://localhost/api/product/create.php",
    type : "POST",
    contentType : 'application/json',
    data : form_data,
    success : function(result) {
        // product was created, go back to products list
        showProducts();
    },
    error: function(xhr, resp, text) {
        // show error to console
        console.log(xhr, resp, text);
    }
});
 
return false;
Output
The output should look like the following.


How To Read One Data Using jQuery AJAX?
Handle “read one” button click
The “read one” button is seen on the “product list” view. When click, it should show the complete product details.

Open “app” folder.
Inside the “app” folder, open “products” folder.
Inside the “products” folder, open “read-one-product.js” file.
Place the following code inside “read-one-product.js” file.

$(document).ready(function(){
 
    // handle 'read one' button click
    $(document).on('click', '.read-one-product-button', function(){
        // product ID will be here
    });
 
});
Get product ID
Our script need to identify the record to be read. We do it by getting the product ID.

Replace “// product ID will be here” of the previous section with the following code.

// get product id
var id = $(this).attr('data-id');
Read one record from API
We will send the product ID to the API. It will return the data based on the given ID.

Place the following code after the previous section’s code.

// read product record based on given ID
$.getJSON("http://localhost/api/product/read_one.php?id=" + id, function(data){
    // read products button will be here
});
Add “read products” button
We need the “read products” button so we can go back to the products list.

Replace “// read products button will be here” of the previous section with the following code.

// start html
var read_one_product_html=`
 
    <!-- when clicked, it will show the product's list -->
    <div id='read-products' class='btn btn-primary pull-right m-b-15px read-products-button'>
        <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-list'></span> Read Products
    </div>
Show record data in HTML table
We will place the product information returned by the API to an HTML table.

Place the following code after the previous section’s code.

<!-- product data will be shown in this table -->
<table class='table table-bordered table-hover'>
 
    <!-- product name -->
    <tr>
        <td class='w-30-pct'>Name</td>
        <td class='w-70-pct'>` + data.name + `</td>
    </tr>
 
    <!-- product price -->
    <tr>
        <td>Price</td>
        <td>` + data.price + `</td>
    </tr>
 
    <!-- product description -->
    <tr>
        <td>Description</td>
        <td>` + data.description + `</td>
    </tr>
 
    <!-- product category name -->
    <tr>
        <td>Category</td>
        <td>` + data.category_name + `</td>
    </tr>
 
</table>`;
Show “Read One Product” HTML table and change page title
We have to make the HTML button and table appear on our web page. We will change the page title as well.

Place the following code after the previous section’s code.

// inject html to 'page-content' of our app
$("#page-content").html(read_one_product_html);
 
// chage page title
changePageTitle("Create Product");
Output
The output should look like the following.


How To Update Data Using jQuery AJAX?
Handle “udpate product” button click
The “edit” button is seen on the “product list” view. When click, it should show the “update product” form filled out with product information.

Open “app” folder.
Inside the “app” folder, open “products” folder.
Inside the “products” folder, open “update-product.js” file.
Place the following code inside “update-product.js” file.

$(document).ready(function(){
 
    // show html form when 'update product' button was clicked
    $(document).on('click', '.update-product-button', function(){
        // product ID will be here
    });
 
    // 'update product form' submit handle will be here
});
8.2 Get product ID
Our script need to identify the record to be read. We do it by getting the product ID.

Replace “// product ID will be here” of the previous section with the following code.

// get product id
var id = $(this).attr('data-id');
Read product information
To fill out our “update product” HTML form, we need to get product information from the API.

Place the following code after the previous section’s code.

// read one record based on given product id
$.getJSON("http://localhost/api/product/read_one.php?id=" + id, function(data){
 
    // values will be used to fill out our form
    var name = data.name;
    var price = data.price;
    var description = data.description;
    var category_id = data.category_id;
    var category_name = data.category_name;
 
    // load list of categories will be here
});
Get list of categories
A list of categories is needed for product category options. Category records will be rendered as options in a “select” HTML input field.

Replace “// load list of categories will be here” of the previous section with the following code.

// load list of categories
$.getJSON("http://localhost/api/category/read.php", function(data){
 
    // build 'categories option' html
    // loop through returned list of data
        var categories_options_html=`<select name='category_id' class='form-control'>`;
 
        $.each(data.records, function(key, val){
            // pre-select option is category id is the same
            if(val.id==category_id){ categories_options_html+=`<option value='` + val.id + `' selected>` + val.name + `</option>`; }
 
            else{ categories_options_html+=`<option value='` + val.id + `'>` + val.name + `</option>`; }
        });
        categories_options_html+=`</select>`;
 
    // update product html will be here
});
Add “Read Products” button
The “read products” button is needed so that we can go back to the products list.

Replace “// update product html will be here” of the previous section with the following code.

// store 'update product' html to this variable
var update_product_html=`
    <div id='read-products' class='btn btn-primary pull-right m-b-15px read-products-button'>
        <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-list'></span> Read Products
    </div>
Build “Update Product” form
Now we will build the “update product” HTML form. This form will be built with an HTML table and the input fields are filled out with product information.

Place the following code after the previous section’s code.

<!-- build 'update product' html form -->
<!-- we used the 'required' html5 property to prevent empty fields -->
<form id='update-product-form' action='#' method='post' border='0'>
    <table class='table table-hover table-responsive table-bordered'>
 
        <!-- name field -->
        <tr>
            <td>Name</td>
            <td><input value=\"` + name + `\" type='text' name='name' class='form-control' required /></td>
        </tr>
 
        <!-- price field -->
        <tr>
            <td>Price</td>
            <td><input value=\"` + price + `\" type='number' min='1' name='price' class='form-control' required /></td>
        </tr>
 
        <!-- description field -->
        <tr>
            <td>Description</td>
            <td><textarea name='description' class='form-control' required>` + description + `</textarea></td>
        </tr>
 
        <!-- categories 'select' field -->
        <tr>
            <td>Category</td>
            <td>` + categories_options_html + `</td>
        </tr>
 
        <tr>
 
            <!-- hidden 'product id' to identify which record to delete -->
            <td><input value=\"` + id + `\" name='id' type='hidden' /></td>
 
            <!-- button to submit form -->
            <td>
                <button type='submit' class='btn btn-info'>
                    <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-edit'></span> Update Product
                </button>
            </td>
 
        </tr>
 
    </table>
</form>`;
Show “Update Product” form and change page title
We need to show our “update product” HTML on our webpage. We will change the page title as well.

Put the following code after the previous section’s code.

// inject to 'page-content' of our app
$("#page-content").html(update_product_html);
 
// chage page title
changePageTitle("Update Product");
Handle “udpate product” form submission
If the “update product” form is submitted, we need a script to handle it.

Find “// 'update product form‘ submit handle will be here” and replace it with the following code.

// will run if 'create product' form was submitted
$(document).on('submit', '#update-product-form', function(){
 
    // get form data will be here 
 
    return false;
});
Get form data
We will get the product information from our “update product” HTML form.

Replace “// get form data will be here” of the previous section with the following code.

// get form data
var form_data=JSON.stringify($(this).serializeObject());
Send form data to server
After getting the form data, we will send the data to our API.

Place the following code after the previous section’s code.

// submit form data to api
$.ajax({
    url: "http://localhost/api/product/update.php",
    type : "POST",
    contentType : 'application/json',
    data : form_data,
    success : function(result) {
        // product was created, go back to products list
        showProducts();
    },
    error: function(xhr, resp, text) {
        // show error to console
        console.log(xhr, resp, text);
    }
});
Output
The output should look like the following.


How To Delete Data Using AJAX?
Handle “Delete Product” button click
The “delete product” button is seen in the “read products” view. When it was clicked, we need to handle it.

Open “app” folder.
Inside the “app” folder, open “products” folder.
Inside the “products” folder, open “delete-product.js” file.
Place the following code inside “delete-product.js” file.

$(document).ready(function(){
 
    // will run if the delete button was clicked
    $(document).on('click', '.delete-product-button', function(){
        // product id will be here
    });
});
Get product ID
The product ID is needed to identify which record to delete using the API.

Replace “// product id will be here” of the previous section with the following code.

// get the product id
var product_id = $(this).attr('data-id');
Show “delete confirmation” dialog box
This is where we will use the Bootbox.js library. We will show a dialog box with “Are you sure?” message with “Yes” and “No” buttons.

Place the following code after the previous section’s code.

// bootbox for good looking 'confirm pop up'
bootbox.confirm({
 
    message: "<h4>Are you sure?</h4>",
    buttons: {
        confirm: {
            label: '<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span> Yes',
            className: 'btn-danger'
        },
        cancel: {
            label: '<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove"></span> No',
            className: 'btn-primary'
        }
    },
    callback: function (result) {
        // delete request will be here
    }
});
Delete record using API
If the user clicked “Yes” on the dialog box, a “delete” request will be sent to the API.

Replace “// delete request will be here” of the previous section with the following code.

if(result==true){
 
    // send delete request to api / remote server
    $.ajax({
        url: "http://localhost/api/product/delete.php",
        type : "POST",
        dataType : 'json',
        data : JSON.stringify({ id: product_id }),
        success : function(result) {
 
            // re-load list of products
            showProducts();
        },
        error: function(xhr, resp, text) {
            console.log(xhr, resp, text);
        }
    });
 
}
Output

How To Search Data Using jQuery AJAX?
This feature is part of our LEVEL 2 source code.

Include two JS file in index.html
<!-- products scripts -->
<script src="app/products/products.js"></script>
<script src="app/products/search-product.js"></script>
Create products.js file
The “products.js” file will contain any functions that can be used by other product components like our “read-products.js” or “search-products.js” files.

Open “app” folder. Open “products” folder. Create “products.js” file.

Open the “products.js” file and put the following code.

// product list html
function readProductsTemplate(data, keywords){
 
    var read_products_html=`
        <!-- search products form -->
        <form id='search-product-form' action='#' method='post'>
        <div class='input-group pull-left w-30-pct'>
 
            <input type='text' value='` + keywords + `' name='keywords' class='form-control product-search-keywords' placeholder='Search products...' />
 
            <span class='input-group-btn'>
                <button type='submit' class='btn btn-default' type='button'>
                    <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-search'></span>
                </button>
            </span>
 
        </div>
        </form>
 
        <!-- when clicked, it will load the create product form -->
        <div id='create-product' class='btn btn-primary pull-right m-b-15px create-product-button'>
            <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-plus'></span> Create Product
        </div>
 
        <!-- start table -->
        <table class='table table-bordered table-hover'>
 
            <!-- creating our table heading -->
            <tr>
                <th class='w-25-pct'>Name</th>
                <th class='w-10-pct'>Price</th>
                <th class='w-15-pct'>Category</th>
                <th class='w-25-pct text-align-center'>Action</th>
            </tr>`;
 
    // loop through returned list of data
    $.each(data.records, function(key, val) {
 
        // creating new table row per record
        read_products_html+=`<tr>
 
            <td>` + val.name + `</td>
            <td>$` + val.price + `</td>
            <td>` + val.category_name + `</td>
 
            <!-- 'action' buttons -->
            <td>
                <!-- read product button -->
                <button class='btn btn-primary m-r-10px read-one-product-button' data-id='` + val.id + `'>
                    <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-eye-open'></span> Read
                </button>
 
                <!-- edit button -->
                <button class='btn btn-info m-r-10px update-product-button' data-id='` + val.id + `'>
                    <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-edit'></span> Edit
                </button>
 
                <!-- delete button -->
                <button class='btn btn-danger delete-product-button' data-id='` + val.id + `'>
                    <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-remove'></span> Delete
                </button>
            </td>
        </tr>`;
    });
 
    // end table
    read_products_html+=`</table>`;
 
    // inject to 'page-content' of our app
    $("#page-content").html(read_products_html);
}
Create search-product.js file
The “search-product.js” file will contain a code that catches the submission of the “search product” form.

Open “app” folder. Open the “products” folder. Create “search-products.js” file.

Open the “search-products.js” file and put the following code.

$(document).ready(function(){
 
    // when a 'search products' button was clicked
    $(document).on('submit', '#search-product-form', function(){
 
        // get search keywords
        var keywords = $(this).find(":input[name='keywords']").val();
 
        // get data from the api based on search keywords
        $.getJSON("http://localhost/api/product/search.php?s=" + keywords, function(data){
 
            // template in products.js
            readProductsTemplate(data, keywords);
 
            // chage page title
            changePageTitle("Search products: " + keywords);
 
        });
 
        // prevent whole page reload
        return false;
    });
 
});
Change read-products.js
We want the “product list” and “search product” to have the same HTML table template. To do this, we will use the readProductsTemplate() function of the products.js file.

Open “app” folder. Open “products” folder. Open the “read-products.js’ file. Change the showProducts() function to the following code.

// function to show list of products
function showProducts(){
 
    // get list of products from the API
    $.getJSON("http://localhost/api/product/read.php", function(data){
 
        // html for listing products
        readProductsTemplate(data, "");
 
        // chage page title
        changePageTitle("Read Products");
 
    });
}
Output

How To Paginate Data Using jQuery AJAX?
This feature is part of our LEVEL 2 and LEVEL 3 source codes.

Change JSON URL
To make pagination work, we’ll have to change the JSON URL. The contents of this new JSON data will include the “paging” node. It looks like the following.


So we will change the JSON URL from:

http://localhost/api/product/read.php
to

http://localhost/api/product/read_paging.php
It means we have to change something in our code. See the change in the next section.

Show products using JSON URL
Open /app/products/read-products.js file. Replace the code with the following.

$(document).ready(function(){
 
    // show list of product on first load
    showProductsFirstPage();
 
    // when a 'read products' button was clicked
    $(document).on('click', '.read-products-button', function(){
        showProductsFirstPage();
    });
 
    // when a 'page' button was clicked
    $(document).on('click', '.pagination li', function(){
        // get json url
        var json_url=$(this).find('a').attr('data-page');
 
        // show list of products
        showProducts(json_url);
    });
 
});
 
function showProductsFirstPage(){
    var json_url="http://localhost/api/product/read_paging.php";
    showProducts(json_url);
}
 
// function to show list of products
function showProducts(json_url){
 
    // get list of products from the API
    $.getJSON(json_url, function(data){
 
        // html for listing products
        readProductsTemplate(data, "");
 
        // chage page title
        changePageTitle("Read Products");
 
    });
}
Add Pagination HTML
Open /app/products/products.js file. Find the ending “table” tag and put the following code under it.

// pagination
if(data.paging){
    read_products_html+="<ul class='pagination pull-left margin-zero padding-bottom-2em'>";
 
        // first page
        if(data.paging.first!=""){
            read_products_html+="<li><a data-page='" + data.paging.first + "'>First Page</a></li>";
        }
 
        // loop through pages
        $.each(data.paging.pages, function(key, val){
            var active_page=val.current_page=="yes" ? "class='active'" : "";
            read_products_html+="<li " + active_page + "><a data-page='" + val.url + "'>" + val.page + "</a></li>";
        });
 
        // last page
        if(data.paging.last!=""){
            read_products_html+="<li><a data-page='" + data.paging.last + "'>Last Page</a></li>";
        }
    read_products_html+="</ul>";
}
Output
After making the changes above, run index.html again. Do a hard refresh. You should see the paging buttons like the one below.

Hi, Mike, how are you?
Thanks for the tutorials. They’ve been most helpful.
I’ve followed the SIMPLE REST MYSQL tutorial, the authentication tutorial that followed that and now I’m working on the PHP OOP AJAX CRUD tutorial. But, I’ve run into a bit of an issue.
I’ve followed all the steps in the tutorial but nothing has ever displayed on the screen.

I’m looking at your Bootstrap for beginners tutorial and I’m recognizing that must have something to do with the index.html file. But, I’m not certain what the problem with it could be.

Could it be that the CDN source is too old and is no longer being used?
I’m going to try a more recent CDN.

I’m asking because I’m not seeing anything describing this problem on stack overflow or other websites.

Hi Jimmy, I’m doing great! How are you? Thank you for the kind words, I’m glad our tutorials were able to help with your coding journey!

About the issue, I cannot reproduce it. Can you right click your page > click Inspect > click Console tab. Take a screenshot and send it here. We want to see an error message so we can know exactly how to solve it.

I’m having a problem with my index.html file remaining totally blank.

I’ve changed the bootstrap CDN to

I’ve downloaded the bootbox master file from the github repository extracted it and placed it in the js folder in the assets folder. Is that what you meant by download bootbox? Because there is no link to bootbox.min.js on the link you gave.

Also, the bootbox-master zip does NOT contain bootbox.min.js.

I’m using this cdn as well for bootstrap Javascript.


and finally I’m attempting to use bootstrap.js in the following way:-

script src=”app/assets/js/bootbox-master/bootbox.js”

I’m making these changes because I’m kind of desperate.

I’ve followed two of your tutorials ..the Simple PHP MYSQL REST Service one..that went well.
I adapted it to my own database and that seemed to go fine.
I’ve tried the JWT JSON PHP REST service, authentication one and that went well as well
But this one will not work at all.
The only thing it has in common with your tutorial is the image at the very beginning when the JSON API is working.

It’s been completely blank screens since then.
I’m going to redo it..hopefully I will find my error.
In the meantime, I made the changes listed out of sheer desperation because there does not seem to be a simple fix for this.

Or at least there’s not one on Stack Overflow (but everything hints that this is a bootstrap problem.
I’m runnning BunsenLabs Lithium, by the way, a Debian 10 distro.
I’m using XAMPP as my webserver.

I know it’s difficult but can you advise me re this problem, please?
I’d appreciate your input when you have the time.

Hi @slowestjcanindeworld,

Thank you for your comment! Here are my answers:

1. In the tutorial above, we’re using an older version of Bootstrap. It works on my end without issues. If you need to upgrade your Bootstrap version, that’s okay.

But when following our tutorial above, I would suggest you follow the exact version I’m using – to make it work first. After you make it work, that’s the time you can try to upgrade.

2. About Bootbox, I changed it to a CDN. The same with jQuery. No need to download anything. See my update above.

3. I added screenshots of my output above. It does not show an empty page.

Thank you for this very good tutorial! :) I am just trying to figure out how to prevent anyone from altering my data? I mean I am building a website based on this, and I only want myself to be able to add, update and delete data in the DB.. should I just leave those parts out and move them to some secret folder behind password?

Hi @WAX1, you’re welcome and thanks for the kind words! In that case, yes, you can do what you suggested. Another option is to build your own login system. Unfortunately, we don’t have an AJAX tutorial about that yet. But this might help you https://www.codeofaninja.com/2013/03/php-login-script.html

when you get to the search, the api does not have a search.php file, it was never addressed in the api tutorial.

“7.4 Put the most important DIV tag
Inside this “div” tag is where every main content of the page will be loaded. We put “page-content” as ID reference because its content will be dynamic. Add the following code after the code on section 5.3.”

There is no section 5.3. Right?
